Thus, line 4 simply fits the current residuals and the line search (line 5) produces the result $p_m = \\beta_m \\ where \\beta_m$ where $\\beta_m$ is the minimizing $\\beta$ of line 4. Therefore, gradient boosting on squared-error loss produces the usual stagewise approach ofiteratively fitting the current residuals\n",
